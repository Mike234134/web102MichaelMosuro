# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
This is lab 2 for the code path web 102 course me and my group members made a clicker game where the user can click on an image and when the user gets to a certain point they can upgrade there clicks to be valuable so for example the normal click is worth 1 point and the upgraded click is worth 2 points and we will subtract the count of the user whenever they get the upgrade.
